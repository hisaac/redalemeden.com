Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order Iâ€™ve noted them down.

### Programming

* What _Write-Ahead Logging_ (WAL) in SQLite is a and how it can be used in the context of Core Data ([link](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/write-ahead-logging-wal/)).

* The _rule of least power_ is a programming principle that prescribes the use of the least powerful programming language capable of solving the problem at hand ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power)). In the same vein, the _principle of least privilege_ refers to the design principle where each abstraction layer in a computer program should only be able to access the resources it needs to do its job ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)).
