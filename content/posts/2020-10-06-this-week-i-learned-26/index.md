Here are some of the things I learned this week, in the order I’ve noted them down.

- Two concepts I learned about this week came straight from Ted Lasso, the Apple TV+ series. The first is the official name of the phenomenon where repeating a word enough causes it to temporarily lose its meaning: *semantic satiation* ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation)). The second is the german word _Schadenfreude_, which means drawing pleasure from the pain that besets others. Coincidentally, it's also trending on Merriam-Webster for an entirely [different reason](https://www.merriam-webster.com/news-trend-watch/schadenfreude-20201002).

- From reading One Piece I picked up a new Japanese expression: 臭いものに蓋 (_kusai-mono-ni-futa_). Its literal meaning is "to cover what stinks". It's figurative meaning is to look the other way or hush up a problem ([link](https://meaning.jp/posts/377)).

- A _snowclone_ is an expression template where replacing one or two words produces an infinite number of variants. Example: _X is the new Y_. There is even [a website](https://snowclones.org) that tracks them!
